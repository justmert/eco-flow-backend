# Repository Statistics

Code frequency: This statistic shows how much code has been added and removed over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of lines added or removed.

Commit history: This statistic shows the number of commits made to a repository over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of commits.

Issue activity: This statistic shows the number of issues that have been opened and closed over time. It could be plotted using a stacked bar chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of issues.

Pull request activity: This statistic shows the number of pull requests that have been opened and closed over time. It could be plotted using a stacked bar chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of pull requests.

Traffic: This statistic shows the number of visitors, page views, and clones of a repository over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of visitors, page views, or clones.

Collaborators: This statistic shows the number of collaborators who have contributed to a repository over time. It could be plotted using a bar chart, with the x-axis representing the collaborators and the y-axis representing the number of contributions.

Release activity: This statistic shows the number of releases made to a repository over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of releases.

Contribution activity: This statistic shows the number of contributions made to a repository over time by different contributors. It could be plotted using a stacked area chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of contributions, and different colors representing different contributors.

Fork activity: This statistic shows the number of forks of a repository over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of forks.

Stars activity: This statistic shows the number of stars a repository has received over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of stars.

Watch activity: This statistic shows the number of watchers a repository has over time. It could be plotted using a line chart, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the number of watchers.

Language usage: This statistic shows the breakdown of different programming languages used in a repository. It could be plotted using a pie chart, with each slice representing a different language and the size of the slice representing the percentage of the code written in that language.
